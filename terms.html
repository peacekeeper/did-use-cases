<p>
This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the
<a>decentralized identifier</a> space by using specialized terms to discuss specific
concepts. This terminology is included below and linked to throughout the
document to aid the reader:
</p>

<dl class="termlist">

  <dt><dfn data-lt="DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn> (DID)</dt>

  <dd>
A globally unique identifier that does
not require a centralized registration authority because it is
registered with <a>distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT) or other form of
decentralized network. The generic format of a DID is defined in the DID
specification [[DID-CORE]]. A specific <a>DID scheme</a> is defined in a
<a>DID method</a> specification.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="did controller(s)">DID controller</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The entity, or a group of entities, in control of a DID and/or <a>DID document</a>.
Note that the <a>DID controller</a> might include the <a>DID subject</a>.
  </dd>


  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID document</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A set of data that describes the <a>DID subject</a>,
including mechanisms, such as public keys and
pseudonymous biometrics, that the <a>DID subject</a> can use to authenticate itself
and prove their association with the DID. A DID document MAY also contain other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing)">attributes</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity">claims</a>
describing the subject. These documents are graph-based data structures that
are typically expressed using [[JSON-LD]], but may be expressed using other
compatible graph-based data formats.
  </dd>


  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID method</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A definition of how a specific <a>DID scheme</a> can be implemented
on a specific <a>distributed ledger</a> or network, including the precise
method(s) by which <a>DIDs</a> are resolved and deactivated and <a>DID
documents</a> are written and updated.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifier registry|decentralized identifier registries">DID registry</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A role a system performs to mediate the creation, verification, updating, and
deactivation of <a>decentralized identifiers</a>.
A DID registry is a type of verifiable data registry (see [[VC-DATA-MODEL]]).
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID resolver</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A system that is capable of retrieving a <a>DID document</a> for a given <a>DID</a>.
These systems are specified in the DID Resolution specification
[[DID-RESOLUTION]].
  </dd>
  </dt>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID subject</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The DID subject is the entity that the <a>DID document</a> is about, i.e.,
it is the entity identified by the <a>DID</a> and described by the <a>DID
document</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID URL</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
A DID plus an optional DID path, optional <code>?</code> character followed by a
DID query, and optional <code>#</code> character followed by a DID fragment.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="">DID scheme</dfn></dt>

  <dd>
The formal syntax of a <a>decentralized identifier</a>. The generic DID
scheme is defined in the DID specification [[DID-CORE]]. Separate <a>DID method</a> specifications
define a specific DID scheme that works with that specific <a>DID method</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn data-lt="distributed ledger technology|DLT">distributed ledger</dfn> (DLT)</dt>

  <dd>
A <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database">distributed
database</a> in which the various nodes use a <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus
protocol</a> to maintain a shared ledger in which each transaction is
cryptographically signed and chained to the previous transaction.
  </dd>
